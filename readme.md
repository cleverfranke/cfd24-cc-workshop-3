# Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the **3rd installment of the CFD '24 Creative Coding Workshops**. This repo contains various example sketches and exercises that were used throughout the workshop, designed to help participants gain a deeper understanding of creative coding concepts using p5.js.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each with a specific purpose:

- **`assignment/`**  
  This folder contains all the sketches related to the larger assignment. These are more complex examples that build on the skills and concepts introduced in the earlier exercises. You can reference or expand upon these for your own projects.

- **`exercise/`**  
  This folder includes explanatory sketches that serve as starting exercises. These are simpler, step-by-step examples meant to guide you through foundational concepts.

- **`map-examples/`**  
  In this folder, you will find tutorial sketches demonstrating how to use p5.js's `map()` function effectively. This function is essential for converting values from one range to another and is frequently used in creative coding projects.

- **`src/`**  
  This folder contains the data files and some helper functions required by the examples. You shouldn't need to modify anything in this folder, as it mainly serves as backend support for the sketches.

## How to Use

To start working on any of the provided sketches:

1. Copy and paste the code from the relevant folder (e.g., `assignment/`, `exercise/`, or `map-examples/`) into your `sketch.js` file.
2. If you're creating a new sketch, make sure to **back up your previous work** by saving or copying it to another location.
3. Modify the sketches as needed for your assignments or creative exploration.

Feel free to experiment with the code, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you encounter any issues!

Happy coding!
